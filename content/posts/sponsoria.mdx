Type of engagement: Growth Consultant - Copy & strategy

Challenge 

The team had just successfully organized their first event and wanted a digital presence. However, there was no clarity regarding the brand (not even the niche).

Solution 

Multiple consultations with the leadership team to develop the iconic copy based on their core views

Effects 

✨ The startup has transformed from event organization to AdTech to EdTech to HRTech to Growth Consultancy. But the core copy and taglines stick. 

✨ Ongoing client-consultant relationship.  

✨ I later also helped launch multiple programs, projects, events, PR campaigns, and a creative campaign to forge 100+ partnerships. Check Work Ex for more info.
